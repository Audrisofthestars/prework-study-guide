# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is meant to be a personal study guide going over the different elements of front and back-end web development and coding by creating a repository for notes that cover essential portions of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The goal for creating this project was to allow myself to read my notes on the four main subjects of our prework so that I may recall them whenever I require the information. Another reason for why this project was made is to have it posted onto Github in order to have constructive feedback on any parts of this project I could have improved on. With completing this project, I have learned a great deal of what goes into the basics of web development as well as having a creation made through what I have learned with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
